    <p><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/comfy-guy-yoba-face">YOBA Face</a> is a character made by repurposing the middle frame of the Trollbait / Nobody Is Right exploitable. The face is often used in an image where it is wrapped in a checkered blanket, indicating the almost zen-like state in which in which the anon gamer, reader, movie watcher or casual forum troll settles into their most comfortable spots. On gaming image boards on the Russian Internet, where YOBA stands for "Youth Oriented, Bydlo-Approved", the exploitable is used as a reaction image indicating that the game in conversation is for "rednecks" or other lower-class types.</p>
